I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection: I honestly enjoyed this project. I messed around with html a lot back in 2020, and have since forgotten most
of the basic syntax. This project was a great refresher. There was nothing inherently difficult for me, and I even enjoyed
playing around with the table to get it to look the way I wanted. It was also great learning how to use git and github to
host a website.

<div class="parent" align="center"><h2>Short Poem</h2>
<h4>A poem about some adventurous, yet unfortunate bees.</h4></div>

<div class="poem" align="center">
<p><i>The bees in the trees<br>
Feel the breeze from the seas<br>
On a boat that can float<br>
No need to gloat<br>
<br>
The horn sounds the storm<br>
The ship turned around<br>
The bees on the seas<br>
Trying not the dround</i></p>

<div class="parent"><h2>My Personal Interests</h2></div>
<p>I became interested in cyber security at young age, partly due to my unwillingness to concede to<br>
    the restrictions my parents would put on my devices, and partly because the idea that nothing is<br>
    unhackable fascinated me. I loved the thrill of macspoofing, rendering router restrictions useless,<br>
    extracting/bruteforcing restriction passcode hashes, and proving to my friends that I could "guess"<br>
    their wifi password. Such experiences have inspired me to want to learn how to identify <br>
    vulnerabilities and keep software secure as more and more of our lives involve the internet.</p>
<p>Last summer, my now wife, got me into rock climbing, and it's something I really enjoy doing on<br>
    weekends. There's a big difference between outdoor and indoor climbing. I love indoor climbing<br>
    when I want to really work on my technique, but outdoor climbing is my favorite as it brings<br>
    a certain thrill that you don't get in the climbing gym. I think it has to do with the fact<br>
    that if I slip out doors, I'm falling the distance from the last bolt, plus the slack in the<br>
    rope. Let's just say that's not a fun slam against the ragged stone.
</p>
<p>I served as missionary for my church, and was fortunate enough to learn Spanish during my service<br>
    Speaking Spanish has given me the opportunity to connect with many different cultures on a very<br>
    personal level. I love hearing the personal experiences of other's who come from very different<br>
    countries and backgrounds. I also love listening to Spanish music, such as reggeaton and bachata.
